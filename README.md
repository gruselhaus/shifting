I have the feeling there is even nowadays many people who might want to give other non-Google/Facebook/Microsoft[<sup>[1]</sup>](#f1) services a try but simply don't know what else to use. You might be surprised but there is a good quantity of alternatives to pretty much all of Google/Facebook/Microsoft[<sup>[1]</sup>](#f1)'s services. Aside from the better privacy, not only are these alternatives good, they are often even better. I finally had to publish this list of services that I think more people should know about.

This list is about giving services a chance that are not part of one of the largest technology companies. But what's so bad about repeatedly supporting the same big tech companies? For one, it's for the purpose of supporting the competition. More competition means a wider variety of services to choose from. A wider spectrum of tools with perhaps one feature better than the other. A lack of competition means that only very few companies have a lot of power over a large amount of users. We need regulation. Don't you agree they are rich enough?

The hardest thing might be to get used to the new services and stopping habits of visiting the old ones. For years you have used that one service and now you need to get accustomed to a different one. It can be hard at first but just remember that it is possible.

All services listed have privacy unless explicitly mentioned that they don't. And even if they don't, even if they are exactly the same as Google/Facebook/Microsoft[<sup>[1]</sup>](#f1) in regard to privacy (although we do try to avoid that here), it is a step forward to an increase in competition.

This list starts with a popular service and then lists alternatives to it.

## Google (search engines):

* [DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com) (dark theme and others, bangs)
* [StartPage](https://www.startpage.com) (same results as Google but with privacy, dark theme and others)
* [Ecosia](https://www.ecosia.org) (has (the bitter needed) support for the environment)
* [Qwant](https://www.qwant.com) (EU-based)

## YouTube (video platforms):

<!--replace the link with https://invidious.io/ once the site is ready (see https://github.com/iv-org/invidious/issues/1694)-->
* [Invidious](https://invidio.us) (not dead, select an instance): alternative front-end to YouTube with the same videos.
* [NewPipe](https://newpipe.net/) (for Android): alternative front-end to YouTube with the same videos.
* [Odysee](https://odysee.com) or [lbry.tv](https://lbry.tv): open source and with reposts from YouTube.
* [PeerTube](https://joinpeertube.org/instances#instances-list) (select an instance)
* There are others but don't particularly advertise privacy[<sup>[2]</sup>](#f2):
   * Multilingual: [Dailymotion](https://www.dailymotion.com)
   * Japanese: [Niconico](https://www.nicovideo.jp)

## Gmail (email providers):

* [ProtonMail](https://protonmail.com) (free plan: 500 MB storage)
* [Tutanota](https://tutanota.com) (free plan: 1 GB storage)
* [Mailfence](https://mailfence.com) (free plan: 500 MB storage)
* [PrivateEmail](https://privateemail.com) (paid, has a free trial)
* [mailbox.org](https://mailbox.org/en) (paid, has a free trial)

&emsp;Now if you think that the storage these services offer is insufficient,<br>
&emsp;let me tell you that there is actually a good thing to having limited storage.<br>
&emsp;You will be forced to delete spam emails or emails you no longer need<br>
&emsp;and that naturally makes your mailbox smaller, more organised and easier to navigate through.<br>
&emsp;It forces you to make sure your mailbox stays clean, and that's good for your own sake.<br>
&emsp;But even if you don't do so, 500 MB or 1 GB is plenty of space for the average user.

## WhatsApp (messengers):

* [Signal](https://www.signal.org) (open source)
* [Threema](https://threema.ch) (open source)
* [Wickr](https://wickr.com) (not open source)
* [Telegram](https://telegram.org) (not open source)

## Facebook (social media):

* [Mastodon](https://joinmastodon.org)
* [Minds](https://www.minds.com) 

## Google Translate (translators):

&emsp;All of these offer more natural and accurate translations but don't particularly advertise privacy[<sup>[2]</sup>](#f2):

* [DeepL Translate](https://www.deepl.com/translator)
* [Papago](https://papago.naver.com) (probably the best for East Asian languages)

## Chrome (browsers):

* [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/browsers)
* [DuckDuckGo Privacy Browser](https://duckduckgo.com/app) (for mobile, Chromium-based)
* [Tor](https://www.torproject.org)
* [Brave](https://brave.com) (Chromium-based)
* [ungoogled-chromium](https://github.com/Eloston/ungoogled-chromium#downloads) (Chromium-based)

## Google Play (app stores):

&emsp;Privacy-focused:

* [F-Droid](https://f-droid.org)
* [Aurora Store](https://gitlab.com/AuroraOSS/AuroraStore)

&emsp;Also, have you ever wanted to play the newest games from Japan that are unavailable in your region?<br>
&emsp;These APK stores make it possible but don't particularly advertise privacy[<sup>[2]</sup>](#f2):

* [APKPure](https://apkpure.com)
* [APKMirror](https://www.apkmirror.com)

## Google Drive (file storage services):

* [Sync](https://www.sync.com)
* [Nextcloud](https://nextcloud.com)
* [Tresorit](https://tresorit.com)
* [Box](https://www.box.com)

## Windows (operating systems):

&emsp;Worried about whether you will be able to run your tools and games that are said to be Windows-exclusive?<br>
&emsp;You might be surprised but through [WINE](https://www.winehq.org), [Proton](https://www.protondb.com) and other things support has become pretty good.<br>
&emsp;Alongside that and many other things you can enjoy almost never having to restart your computer for updates<br>
&emsp;again. Welcome to the new age of operating systems.

* A Linux distribution, such as for example:
   * [Pop!\_OS](https://pop.system76.com)
   * [Manjaro](https://manjaro.org)
   * [MX Linux](https://mxlinux.org)
   * [Mint](https://linuxmint.com)
   * [Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com)
   * Others: see the list on the right on [https://distrowatch.com/](https://distrowatch.com).

## GitHub (code hosting platforms):

* [GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com) (open source)
* [Gitea](https://gitea.io) (open source)
* [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org) (not open source)

Ironically enough, this list is hosted on the proprietary GitHub, a service owned by Microsoft. For most people it is nowadays hardly possible to escape *all* of the big tech company services. Most of us still carry a phone around that almost always runs either Android or iOS with the need of creating an account and agreeing to policies to get access to basic services we desire.  
But that doesn't mean we can't do anything at all. We can still de-Google/Facebook/Microsoft[<sup>[1]</sup>](#f1) our lives to some degree. The types of services listed on the top are the most common and they are starting point of where we should begin to shift.

### Footnotes

1. <span id="f1"></span>
Although this document only mentions the three classic examples Google, Facebook and Microsoft, that doesn't mean they are the only companies that face a threat to privacy. They are just examples.

2. <span id="f2"></span>
The discouraging ending "but don't particularly advertise privacy" isn't supposed to mean that this service is strictly to be avoided. As mentioned at the start of the document, it contributes to and serves the competition.

### Alternative lists

&emsp;This document is supposed to collect high-quality services into a small list that is quick and easy to choose from.<br>
